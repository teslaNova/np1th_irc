# np1th-irc

One more IRC library. 


#### About

I've just recently started to learn more about Rust and feel a tiny bit experienced enough to start a project to learn even more.
So there we are. 

~~nth-irc is just one more library to work with the IRC protocol. If I've done most of the work on this library I'll start writing a client with `web-view`, if there isn't any better alternative out there.~~

Well, as you can see it's np1th-irc now. Since the last version felt.. like utter crap I restarted and tried to make it a bit more cleaner. Its still not perfect, but a little less crappy.
